# HippoCookBook

Welcome to the HippoCookBook repository! The goal is to have a one-stop-shop repo you need for ephys experiments and data analysis (from session managments, spikes and LFP analysis, plotting and statistics). This repo is based originally in buzcode (https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode) and FMAToolbox (http://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/).
IMPORTANT: everything is under collective development by the lab. If you find something that needs changing/adding, please open an issue and improve it (:
